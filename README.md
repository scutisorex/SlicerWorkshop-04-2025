## Learning objectives:

By the end of this workshop, you will:
- Understand the basic structure of different kinds of 3D data you might work on in Slicer
- Feel comfortable with navigating the Slicer interface and be able to install, open, and update modules
- Be able to import and visualize several types of 3D data
- Know the basics of segmentation and model generation
- Understand how to expand your knowledge of Slicer moving forward, and become familiar with the many Slicer community resources
