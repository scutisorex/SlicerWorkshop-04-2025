## Pre-training and setup!

**Hello workshop participants!**
I'm looking forward to welcoming you to the 3D Slicer workshop on April 14th (Botany Classroom, 9am-4:30pm!). In prep for the workshop, you will need to do a couple things.

### **CHECK YOUR HARDWARE:**
I noted this previously, but it really helps to have a 3-button mouse for manipulating things in Slicer. I think there are a lot of computers around the museum that have them, so if you don’t have one of your own, you might be able to borrow one/liberate one from a lab computer for the day. If you’re gonna buy one, here are [three](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=15907) [different](https://www.anker.com/ca/products/a7852) [options](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-006469) linked in order of increasing quality (and increasing in my own preference), but also increasing in price. I know you guys aren't made of money so pick whatever one works for your purposes.

Double check that the computer you will be using has the appropriate specs for running 3DSlicer, listed [here](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html). If it doesn't, things will run extremely slowly, and you will be deeply irritated. Take the time to check, and ask around to borrow a different machine if your computer is insufficient. I'm sorry to say I don't have any laptops that I can loan you!

### **DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SOFTWARE:**
First: please install **3DSlicer 5.8.1**, the stable version - NOT the preview release. Download it for your OS [here](https://download.slicer.org/) and install it before the workshop. Open it to make sure you installed it correctly. It’s pretty important that you come with the program already installed so that we can jump right in to learning!

Please also install **MeshLab 2023.12**, which is a free, open-source, lightweight  mesh editor that will run on pretty much any computer. Download it for your OS [here](https://www.meshlab.net/#download). 


### **INSTALL SLICERMORPH EXTENSION:**
We will be making extensive use of the SlicerMorph extension during our workshop. Use the instructions on [the front page of the SlicerMorph github](https://github.com/SlicerMorph) to install the extension. 

## **ADDITIONALLY:**
- Lunch will not be provided. Please expect to provide your own lunch!
- I'd recommend you take a look around the [Slicer Discourse](https://discourse.slicer.org/). If you’re planning to use Slicer for your work moving forward, having an account on the Discourse will definitely pay off, so feel free to set that up.
- Please remember to bring the charger for your computer. It will definitely be required.
- If you want to bring your own data, make sure that it is as CT image stacks of some kind (tif stacks, DICOM files, .nrrd stacks). If you've been getting huge data sets from me (like 20-50 GB image stacks), those are probably not going to run on a laptop, unless your laptop has an astronomical amount of ram/a huge GPU. The rule of thumb is that you should have 10x as much memory as the data you try to load. So, for example, if you are trying to load a 800 MB dataset, you should have at least 8GB of ram. I will bring data sets of a few sizes for people to learn on.

I’m looking forward to hanging out and learning with you! Let me know if you have any questions, and see you soon!
